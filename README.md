# Intro

I'm just playing with GitHub Copilot and OpenAI's agent mode in here.
The general idea is to build a Hnefatafl game that runs in-browser (static hosting)
and that I can maybe use with a RL setup to make an AI opponent.

It's probably, like, 95% AI generated code.

âœ… Engine is designed for use in the browser via Vite.
ðŸ§ª If reused in Node.js or other environments (e.g., RL training), a build step or bundler (e.g., esbuild, vite-node) must resolve imports. That is not currently a requirement.

# Overview / Idea / Plan

## Hnefatafl Engine â€“ Simplified SRS

Target: Browser-compatible TypeScript module for use with web components

âœ… Core Features
1. Board Initialization

    Standard 11Ã—11 Hnefatafl layout

    Defenders, King, and Attackers placed per classic rules

    Throne and corners marked for special rules

2. Game State Representation
    ```ts
    interface GameState {
      board: CellState[][];
      currentPlayer: "attacker" | "defender";
      captured: {
        attacker: number;
        defender: number;
      };
      moveHistory: string[];
      status: "in_progress" | "attacker_win" | "defender_win";
    }
    ```
    ```ts
    interface CellState {
      occupant: "attacker" | "defender" | "king" | null;
      isThrone: boolean;
      isCorner: boolean;
    }
    ```
3. Move Format

    Moves are strings like:

    ```
    "E5-E6"                // No capture
    "E7-E6(F9)"            // Single capture
    "D6-D8(D7E7)"          // Multiple captures
    "E5-E6, E7-E6(F9)"     // Sequence of moves
    ```

4. Validation API

    ```ts
    function validateMove(move: string): MoveValidationResult;
    ```
    ```ts
    interface MoveValidationResult {
      isValid: boolean;
      reason?: string;
      expectedCaptures: string[]; // e.g. ["F9", "D7"]
    }
    ```
    Parses one move at a time

    Does not apply the move

    Provides list of available captures for the move, but allows player to choose whether to apply them

    Handles 0â€“4 capture directions (orthogonal only; max 3 is realistic but 4 is technically possible)

5. Commit API

    ```ts
    function applyMove(move: string): ApplyMoveResult;
    ```
    ```ts
    interface ApplyMoveResult {
      success: boolean;
      error?: string;
      newState?: GameState;
    }
    ```
    Revalidates move string

    Checks if listed captures match whatâ€™s possible

    Applies piece movement and capture(s)

    Advances turn if valid

    Returns updated game state or error

6. Game History Parsing

    ```ts
    function applyMoveSequence(moves: string): ApplyMoveResult;
    ```
    Input: comma-separated string of moves

    Applies moves in order, halts on first error

    Returns final state or error

7. Design Constraints

    No exceptions for validation errors â€” use clean return types

    No mandatory captures

    Moves must explicitly list desired captures, even if theyâ€™re available

    Support for use inside a web component context

    Engine must be fully functional in static files

    No external state or async behavior

    Minimal external dependencies (or none)

    ðŸ“Œ Notes
    Capturing multiple enemy pieces in one move is possible (up to 4).

    If a move could capture but the player opts not to list any captures, it is legal.

    Captures indicated that are not possible are rejected by the validator.


# Design Philosophy

Modular: Small, focused files/classes for parsing, validation, state, and rules

Functional core + encapsulated engine class: Core logic is mostly pure functions (easy to test), wrapped by a stateful engine object

Stateless validation: Move validation can be run without mutating state (needed for preview in UI)

Web-component-friendly: No reliance on external frameworks or servers
